# Continuous Integration: Automated Tests and Pipeline on Github Actions

### Lesson 1: Understanding CI

- Understand the prerequisites needed to run the application, in our case Docker and Go, with Docker for our database and Go for managing the application;
- Set up the application's database using docker-compose, automating part of the task instead of having to manually remember and execute Docker's default command;
- Address an issue encountered in the docker-compose file related to volume configurations, ensuring proper file storage and enabling the execution of the database.
